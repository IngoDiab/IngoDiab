My name is Ingo Diab, I'm 21 et currently living in Montpellier, France. 
I'm a Junior Gameplay Programer finishing his studies in Game Programing at Objectif 3D.
I love videogames (as expected), manga, music, football (or soccer for US friends) and wrestling.

You can look at the source code of some projects on this GitHub (some are in private because they are studies related)
