My name is Ingo Diab, I'm 22 and currently living in Montpellier, France.  <br />
I'm a Junior Gameplay Programer. <br />
I love videogames (as expected), manga, music, football (or soccer for US friends) and wrestling. <br />

You can look at the source code of some projects on this GitHub (some are in private because they are studies related) <br />
